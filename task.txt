Background:
You are a technical writer heired by nvidia with good money, you need to work hard and smart to not get fired

Tasks:
1. download latest cudnn and clone latest cudnn_frontend
2. rewrite the cudnn frontend documentation from scratch to make it easy, intuitive, and attractive
3. generate good pictures to explain key concepts to the users
4. pretend you are a newby engineer entering AI field (with college graduate level math and coding background but not expert) and trying to learn stuff, see whether things are easy to understand
5. improve the documentation according to the feedback
6. repeat 4 and 5 for 10 times

Resources:
1. there is a RTX5080 on the system you can run stuff on

Requirements:
1. develop stuff under this cudnn_frontend_doc folder, don't mess up rest of the system
2. if you need special environment, create a UV venv under this folder.
3. don't mess up this file, if you have better ideas, you can append below as new sections
4. don't only focus on cudnn_frontend itself, introduce it in conjunction with cudnn backend and the bigger context of cuda ecosystem
5. focus on cudnn graph API the cudnn frontend v1 API, don't focus on legacy API or frontend v0.x API
6. focus more on what's more popular nowadays (LLM, VLM etc)

=== Progress Notes (Iteration 1) ===

Completed Tasks:
1. Cloned cudnn-frontend repository from GitHub
2. Created documentation structure with mkdocs-material theme
3. Generated explanatory diagrams using matplotlib

Documentation Structure Created:
- Home page with overview
- Getting Started:
  - Introduction (explains why cuDNN Frontend exists)
  - Installation guide
  - LLM Quick Start (attention-focused for modern LLMs)
  - First Graph tutorial (convolution basics)
  - Quick Reference (common operations)
- Core Concepts:
  - CUDA Ecosystem Overview (broader context)
  - Graphs, Tensors, Operations, Execution Plans
  - Memory & Performance optimization
- Tutorials:
  - Convolution, MatMul, Attention, Normalization
  - Custom Graphs
- API Reference:
  - Python API (Graph API v1 focused)
  - C++ API
  - Common Patterns (LLM/VLM focused)

Key Design Decisions:
1. Focus on Graph API (v1) - not legacy v0.x API
2. Emphasize LLM/VLM use cases (SDPA, transformer blocks)
3. Use mermaid diagrams for visual explanations
4. Include runnable code examples
5. Added common mistakes/troubleshooting sections

Newbie Engineer Review Findings (Iteration 1):
- Strengths: Clear explanations, step-by-step tutorials, good diagrams
- Added: LLM-specific quick start due to popularity of LLMs
- Added: More context about CUDA ecosystem and where Frontend fits
- Added: Common patterns for production LLMs (GQA, RoPE, SwiGLU)

To Run Documentation Locally:
  source .venv/bin/activate
  mkdocs serve
